## Education
- M.S., Computer Science	| Centrale Lille	 			        		

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Apprentice@ Leroy Merlin France (_September 2021 - Present_)**
- Helped Product Managers to create craftsmen personas by delivering a clustering model based on craftsmen data.
- Assisted product managers in identifying problems with the time to market of worksites by analyzing worksite data.
- Designed and implemented data pipelines for processing and exposing structured data using kestra (data orchestration tool), Terraform(infrastructure provisioning tool) and SQL.
- Developed dashboards for monitoring business KPIs using Power BI and Looker Studio.
- Facilitated data usage for product managers by developing a semantic layer using Looker's modeling language LookML, making it easier for them to access and analyze data.

**Data Scientist Intern@ Tecnomat Italy (_February 2024 - May2024_)**
- Led a critical project to classify the risk of order delays, collaborating closely with key stakeholders including the head of supply chain and the head of store organization to define business needs and scope.
- Conducted comprehensive data collection and preparation, ensuring robust model input.
- Developed and trained machine learning models using TensorFlow to predict delay risks with high accuracy.
- Industrialized and optimized the model for production environments, deploying it on Vertex AI with TensorFlow Serving and Docker for scalable, real-time performance.
- Engineered a gateway API using FastAPI, deployed on Google Cloud Run, to facilitate efficient model interaction.
- Authored complete project documentation, detailing processes and guidelines for future reference and reproducibility.

**Data Scientist Intern@ Stellantis (_September 2023 - February2024_)**
- I developed an optimization system using the OR-Tools solver in Python. The system takes as input a list of vehicles and constraints, then produces an ordered list of vehicles that meet all the constraints. The goal is to drastically reduce the planning generation time, increase its quality, and reduce the human interactions required to achieve an optimal result.

**Software Engineer Itern@ Fichorga (_May 2021 - July2021_)**
- Reduced training costs for newly released features on a web app by developing a tour guide using JavaScript.

## Personal Projects
### Nba players investments classifier
[Repo](https://github.com/saadbouhya/nba-inves-classifier)

This project aims to predict whether NBA players will have a career lasting more than 5 years, serving as a tool for investors interested in player longevity. The classification model uses player statistics to make predictions.
